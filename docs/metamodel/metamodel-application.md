# Application 

## Teminology 

What is an application ? 

There is no obvious reponse. But anyway, you need a abstraction in order to have a high-level view of your landscape. A pragmatic approach is to decide that an Application is an homogenous set of Application Components seen as one from an external point of view.

## Example

In a bank for example, an Application could be the web banking. Customers use the web banking as their main bank application. From DEV & IT-OPS teams perspective, web bankink application is decomposed into in 3 ou 4 different Application Components separately deployable, that together create the web banking application
